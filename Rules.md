Rules (Will be updated constantly)

You must randomize the character, including race, appearance, starting job and any history.

NO INTENTIONAL OUTSIDE HELP - Meaning no planned partying, no FC creation/joining, no trading/donations (pre-order bonuses are fine unless you are doing hardcore) and most importantly, no Market Board

You must play your job UNTIL you trigger a job switch requirement:

Until Stormblood expansion, finishing the highest level job quest equal or less than the current MSQ level

Finishing a multiplayer instance

You can only switch to jobs that its current level is less or equal to the current MSQ level

You cannot switch jobs if there is only 1 eligible job you can switch to

EXP boosting equipment and consumables cannot be used on the highest level job (or at all if you are doing hardcore)

Non-instance permadeath, meaning that unless you are in a multiplayer instance, you will delete the character if you die

In the case of dying in the multiplayer instance, you will force trigger a job switch, and the job that you died in will be permanently disabled

However! You can use a revive to either prevent a character delete or re-enable a disabled class. To gain a revive:

You must get 3 commendations on a 4 player instance, 6 on an 8/24 player instance. (HOWEVER, DO NOT BEG FOR COMMENDATIONS, it is considered intentional outside help.

Finish an Anima Weapon Quest

Crafting is allowed, and can be started at any time. Note that the job switch rules above still apply, except for multiplayer instances.
You are also allowed to do a variation with no crafting/crafted items only.
